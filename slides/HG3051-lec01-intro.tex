\myslide{100\% Continuous Assessment}


\begin{itemize}
\item Individual Lab Work (4x10\%)
\item Individual Project (20\%) 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  Describe some linguistic phenomenon quantitatively in a 6-page paper (ACL format)
  \item The paper must motivate both the choice of phenomenon and corpus
  \end{itemize}
\item Group Project (30\%) One of:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A program to perform some substantial corpus processing task
  \item The collection and annotation of a new (sub)corpus
  \item[+]     8-page paper (ACL full paper format with extra page for references) describing your approach
  \end{itemize}
\item Class Participation  (10\%)
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Guidelines for Written Work in HG3051}

\begin{itemize}
\item All assignments must follow the \textit{(Computational)
    Linguistic Style Guidelines: a guide for the perplexed. } \\
  \url{http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/fcbond/data/ling-style.pdf}
\item Proper citation is important 
    \\ --- failure to cite is plagiarism --- \textbf{zero} or \textbf{fail}
\item Local Rules
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ACL format for paper submission (No need for LMS title page)
    \\ only the first $n$ pages will be marked
  \item Late assignments get \textbf{zero}
  \item I expect some quantitative analysis
  \item I will try to give you real problems to work on
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Extra Credit}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you submit a patch\footnote{a short set of commands to correct a bug in a computer program} that gets accepted to a corpus or tool we use
  \begin{itemize}
  \item you can get 1-5\% extra credit (depending on the size/difficulty)
    \\ typically 10$^{n-1}$ where $n$ is the number of lines you changed
  \item you can't go over 100\%
  \end{itemize}
\item A patch can involve
  \begin{itemize}
  \item extending the corpus/code with new capabilities
  \item fixing a bug in annotation/code
  \item fixing a bug in or extending documentation
    \begin{itemize}
    \item fixing a spelling error; rewording for clarity; translating to a new language
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item Has to be for this course (not overlap with URECA, project, HG2051, \ldots)

\myslide{Student Responsibilities}

By remaining in this class, the student agrees to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Make a good-faith effort to learn and enjoy the material.
\item  Read assigned texts and participate in class discussions and activities.
\item Submit assignments on time.
\item Attend class at all times, barring special circumstances (see below).
\item Get help early: approach me when you first have trouble understanding a concept or homework problem rather than complaining about a lack of understanding afterward.
\item Treat other students with respect in all class-related activities, including on-line discussions.
\end{enumerate}
\myslide{Attendance}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You are expected to attend all classes.

\item A medical emergency (including mental health emergencies)
\item A family emergency (death, birth, natural disaster, etc).
\end{enumerate}
You must provide documentation to me and the student office.
\item There will be significant material covered in class that is not in your readings.  You cannot expect to do well without coming to class.

\end{enumerate}

\myslide{Remediation and Academic Integrity}
\begin{enumerate}
\item No late work will be accepted, except in the case of a documented excuse.
\item For planned, justified, absences on class days or days on which assignments are due, advance notice must be provided.
\item Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations, including plagiarism, will be seriously dealt with, and could result in \textbf{a failing grade for the entire course}.
\item For all other issues of academic integrity, refer to the University Honour Code: \url{http://www.ntu.edu.sg/sao/Pages/HonourCode.aspx}
\item As always, use your common sense and conscience.
\end{enumerate}

\myslide{What is a Corpus?}

\lx{corpus} (pl: \lx{corpora}):
\begin{enumerate}
\item A collection of texts, especially if
complete and self-contained: the corpus of
Anglo-Saxon verse.
\item In linguistics and lexicography, a body of texts, utterances, or other
specimens considered more or less representative
of a language, and usually stored as an electronic
database. Currently, computer corpora may store
many millions of running words, whose features can
be analyzed by means of tagging (the addition of
identifying and classifying tags to words and other
formations) and the use of concordancing
programs. Corpus linguistics studies data in any
such corpus \ldots
\end{enumerate}
(from \textit{The Oxford Companion to the English Language}, ed.
McArthur \& McArthur, 1992)

\myslide{Definition of a corpus}
\begin{itemize}
\item  In principle, any collection of more than one text can be called a
\txx{corpus}
\item  Characteristics of modern corpora:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item machine-readable (i.e., computer-based)
  \item authentic (i.e., naturally occurring)
  \item sampled (bits of text taken from multiple sources)
  \item representative of a particular language or language variety.
  \end{itemize}
\item  \citet[171]{Sinclair:1991}:
  \begin{quote}
    A corpus is a collection of naturally-occurring language text, chosen to characterize a state of variety of language.
\end{quote}
% \item Corpus linguistics is the study of language as expressed in samples
% (corpora) or ``real world'' text.
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Why Are Electronic Corpora Useful?}
\begin{itemize}
\item as a collection of examples for linguists
\item as a data resource for lexicographers
\item as instruction material for language teachers and learners
\item as training material for natural language processing applications
  \begin{itemize}
  \item training of speech recognizers
  \item training of statistical part-of-speech taggers and parsers
  \item training of example-based and statistical machine translation systems
  \end{itemize}
\item ``Big Data'' is just another corpus, to analyze it wisely
  requires the same techniques

\end{itemize}



\myslide{Examples for Linguists}

Give examples for English noun phrases \ldots

\myslide{Examples for Linguists}
Examples from the Penn treebank:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{USX 's transition from Big Steel to Big Oil}
  \ex \eng{Pittsburgh instead of New York or Findlay,  Ohio, Marathon 's home}
  \ex \eng{his concern about boosting shareholder value}
  \ex \eng{the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46}
  \ex \eng{a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a \$7.19 billion Icahn bid by about \$3
  billion}
\ex \eng{an undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs }
\ex \eng{the sale of the reserves of Texas Oil \& Gas, which was acquired three years ago and
hasn't posted any significant operating profits since}
\end{exe}



\myslide{Some Linguists dismiss Corpus Linguistics}

\begin{quotation}
\ldots it is obvious that the set of grammatical
sentences cannot be identified with any particular corpus
of utterances \ldots  

\bigskip
\ldots a grammar mirrors the behavior of the speaker, who,
on the basis of a finite and accidental experience with
language, can produce or understand an indefinite
number of new sentences.   

\bigskip
\ldots  ones's ability to produce and recognize
grammatical utterances is not based on notions of
statistical approximations or the like.
\ldots  If we rank the sequences of a given length in order of
statistical approximation to English, we will find both
grammatical and ungrammatical sequences scattered
throughout the list; there appears to be no particular
relation between the order of approximations and
grammatical.  
\\ \mbox{} \hfill \citet[pp15--17]{Chomsky:1957} \textit{Syntactic Structures}  
\end{quotation}

\myslide{Can grammaticality be predicted?}

%\myslide{What is grammatical and what isn't?}
 \begin{exe}
 \ex\label{gram} {~}\eng{Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.}
 \ex\label{ungram} *\eng{Furiously sleep ideas green colorless.}
 \hfill (Chomsky, 1957: as (1) and (2))
 \end{exe}
 \begin{quote}
   It is fair to assume that neither sentence (\ref{gram}) nor
   (\ref{ungram}) (nor indeed any part of these sentences) has ever
   occurred in an English discourse. Hence, in any statistical model
   for grammaticalness, these sentences will be ruled out on identical
   grounds as equally `remote' from English. Yet (\ref{gram}), though
   nonsensical, is grammatical, while (\ref{ungram}) is not.
 \end{quote}

\txx{Not really:}
Using a simple probabilistic model (based only on the probability of a
word occurring given the two proceeding words) \citet{Pereira:2000} showed
that P(\ref{gram}) $\gg$ P(\ref{ungram}) ($\times 200,000$).

  \eng{It can only be the thought of verdure to come, which prompts us in
  the autumn to buy these dormant white lumps of vegetable matter
  covered by a brown papery skin, and lovingly to plant them and care

  labouring unseen at such a rate within to give us the sudden awesome
  beauty of spring flowering bulbs. While winter reigns the earth
  reposes but these colourless green ideas sleep furiously.}

\myslide{General vs. specialized corpora}
\begin{itemize}
\item General corpora (such as “national” corpora) are a huge undertaking.
These are built on an institutional scale over the course of many years.
\item  Specialized corpora (ex: corpus of English essays written by Japanese
university students, medical dialogue corpus) can be built relatively
quickly for the purpose at hand, and therefore are more common
\item Characteristics of corpora:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Machine-readable, authentic
  \item Sampled to be balanced and representative
  \end{enumerate}
\newpage
\item  Trend: for specialized corpora, criteria in (2) are often weakened in favor of quick assembly and large size
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Do-it-yourself corpora
  \item World-Wide Web as a corpus
  \item Google 1T corpus

\begin{description}
\item [MORPHOLOGY]: Look for words starting with the prefix \eng{dis-}
  (e.g. \eng{dissent}).  What are the three most common singular nouns
  (\url{dis*.[nn1]}), the three most common adjectives (\url{dis*.[j*]}), and the
  three most common infinitival verbs (\url{dis*.[vvi]})

\item [LEXICAL]: Search for \eng{robot} [using CHARTS] and then
  compare the frequency in the five main genres.  In which genre is it
  the most/least common? In which sub-genre is it the most common
  (click on [SEE ALL SECTIONS]
\newpage

 \item [COLLOCATIONS]: What are the 5 most frequent adjectives with
   \eng{curry} as a noun (\url{curry.[nn*]})? (CONTEXT = [j*], [4] [4], [SORT] =
   [FREQUENCY]). Now change to [SORT] = [RELEVANCE]. What are the five
   most highly-ranked adjectives. What has changed, and why?

\item[GRAMMATICAL]: In which genre is the present perfect (\url{has
    [vvn*]}) and the past perfect (\url{had [vvn*]}) most common? Any
  idea why? (you can use CHART)

\item[LEXICO-GRAMMAR]: Look at the top five adjectives following
  \eng{come} and \eng{go} ( use [COMPARE WORDS]; WORD(S) = come , go;
  CONTEXT =  [j*] [0] [2]). Is there any pattern in terms of which
  adjectives occur with the two verbs?

\newpage
\item[SEMANTICS]: Compare the collocates of \eng{find} and
  \eng{discover} ( use [COMPARE WORDS]; WORD(S) = find.[v*] ,
  discover.[v*]; CONTEXT = [nn*] [0] [2]). Any patterns here?

\item[LEXICO-GRAMMAR]: Compare the five most common phrases with
  \url{we [v*]} in SPOKEN vs ACADEMIC.  What is the major difference
  between the two registers? (use LIST with SECTIONS)

\item[LEXICAL]: Compare the most frequent singular and plural nouns
  (\url{[nn1*]} and \url{[nn2*]}) in MAGAZINE vs ACADEMIC).  Which
  types are more common in each register? (Use two searches in LIST)
