<h1><a href='index.html'>HG3051</a> Lab 3: SQL</h1>

<p>This lab will give you practice using SQL.  We will
use <a href='https://www.sqlite.org/'>SQLite</a> (e.g. using
the <a href='http://sqlitebrowser.org/'>DB Browser for SQLite</a>) to
search through the <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc/'>NTU
Multilingual Corpus</a> (NTU-MC).  The NTU-MC is a multilingual
sense-tagged corpus. You'll be provided with working databases for
both English and Mandarin Chinese (but you don't need to have any
command of Mandarin Chinese to complete this assignment).

<p>Please answer each question providing both the SQL query, the
retrieved answer and where necessary some discussion.  Please use
  the <tt>eng_new.db</tt> database.

<p>Upload the final lab report through ntulearn as pdf
  <br>It should be called  <b>lab3-yourname.pdf</b>

<p>Replace the ??? with your answers.

<p>This is a simplified explanation of the tables you'll have to use:
<pre>
table: concept
sid|cid|clemma|tag|tags|comment|ntag|usrname
sid - sentence id (unique)
cid - concept id (unique only in a given sentence)
clemma - concept lemma (may be a multi-word expression)
tag - concept tag (may be a synset, or a number of other predefined tags that you don't need to know about)
tags - IGNORE
comment - IGNORE
ntag - IGNORE
usrname - IGNORE

table: word
sid|wid|word|pos|lemma|cfrom|cto|comment|usrname
sid - sentence id (unique)
wid - word id (unique only in a given sentence)
word - word surface form
pos - part-of-speech (consult http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc/ for the tag sets)
cfrom - IGNORE
cto - IGNORE
comment - IGNORE
usrname - IGNORE

### not actually used 
table: cwl (concept to word links for each sentence) 
sid|wid|cid|usrname
sid - sentence id (unique)
wid - word id (unique only in a given sentence) 
cid - concept id (unique only in a given sentence)
usrname - IGNORE
</pre>


<h3>Q1: (2)</h3>
<p>What is the most frequent word in the English Corpus? And in the (Mandarin) Chinese Corpus?

<p>???

<h3>Q2: (2)</h3>

<p>What are the total number of words tagged respectively as Adjective, Noun, Verb
and Adverb (using the Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset) for English?
And for Chinese? (Please use the mappings provided
by <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc/'>NTU-MC</a>).
<p>Your answer should have eight numbers (one for each POS+Language
combination) and possibly eight queries.

<p>???


<h3>Q3: (4)</h3>
<p>What are the five concepts with the most variety in lemmas for
 English and Mandarin (i.e. the synsets with the most different
 lemmas).  Please ignore tags that are not synsets, i.e. the tag must
 be of the form: xxxxxxxx-p (where x are numbers and p is the pos
 code).

<p>???

<p>Look the synsets up in the corpus search and
the <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/cgi-bin/wn-gridx.cgi?gridmode=grid/'>open
multilingual wordnet</a> and look at the lemmas (in either English,
Mandarin or both): why do you think these concepts have so many
lemmas.  Note that you can put the concept id (xxxxxxxx-p) in the
  search box for OMW.   Some concepts are new at NTU and may not show
  up (those starting with 7,8 or 9).

<p>???



<h3>Q4: (2)</h3>
<p>Compare the frequency of usage of adjectives (using Petrov, Das and
McDonald's Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset) between English and
Chinese.  Use the Frequency Comparison provided at
<a href='http://sigil.collocations.de/wizard.html'>http://sigil.collocations.de/wizard.html</a>. Using
the Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset and the NTU-MC as sample, can we
say that any of the two languages differ (significantly) in the usage
of adjectives?  (Please show any new queries used, the input you give
to the wizard, and paste the statistical results along with a short
answer).

<p>???
