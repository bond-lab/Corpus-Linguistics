<h1><a href='index.html'>COR</a> 
Lab 2: Describing A Corpus</h1>

<p>Present in Week 4.

<p>This lab will give you knowledge about a particular corpus.

<p>Prepare a 5 minute presentation (5-6 slides) introducing a corpus to the class.

<p> Pick a corpus that interests you (that I haven't described already
and isn't described in the week 4 slides).  The corpus has to have at
least two papers about it: one describing its construction, and
another describing research using it.  You will be expected to read
both papers and be able to ask questions about them.  The slides
should be a <b>very</b> concise summary.

<ul>
  <li>Slide 1: General Corpus Description (your name as footnote)
  <li>Slide 2~3: Overview of Annotation/Creation
  <li>Slide 3~4: Use of the corpus in some research
  <li>Slide 4/5: References (must have at least the following)
    <ul>
      <li> one paper about corpus construction
      <li> one paper about corpus use
      <li> details of how to access the corpus (URL)
    </ul>
  <li>Slide 5/6: <a href='http://www.islrn.org/basic_metadata/'>ISLRN
      Metadata</a> for the corpus, presented as a human readable table.
</ul>

<p>Example Slides: <a href='pdf/hkcancor.pdf'>The Hong Kong Cantonese Corpus</a>

<h3>Assessment Criteria:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> description of/presentation about the corpus  (2 marks)
  <li> description of/presentation about the corpus creation/annotation (2 marks)
  <li> description of/presentation about the corpus use (2 marks)
  <li> references, formatted correctly (-1 mark if not done)
  <li> asked interesting question(s) (2 marks)
  <li> answered question well (2 marks)
</ul>
<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> email me with your choice of corpus (before class in week3)
  <li>  Upload slides as pdf
  <br>It should be called  <b>lab2-yoursurname-corpus_name.pdf</b>
 (one day after the class in
  which you presented them: to give a chance for revisions)
  <br> e.g.  <b>lab2-bond-Happiness_Corpus.pdf</b>
    <br>Unless specifically requested not to, I will put your slides
    up <a href='lab2-corpora.html'>on their own page</a> so that other people can also see them.
</ul>

<h4>Note on formatting slides (and other things)</h4>
<p> Read and follow the instructions carefully.

<ul> 
  <li>Lose 1 mark if:
    <ul>
      <li>  Submit anything but pdf 
      <li>  More or less than 5 or 6 pages
      <li>  Name not as footnote on page one
    </ul>
  <li> 0 if submitted late
  <li> Why so strict?
 <ul>
   <li>For paper/grant submissions 
     <br> --- your submission paper will be rejected without review if badly formatted
   <li>  In the workplace
     <br> --- you will get shouted at and made to do it again
   <li> Why is correct formatting so important?
     <ul>
       <li> The reviewer/boss has to read/process many, many submissions
       <li> Anything that distracts them/takes extra time is bad
     </ul>
 </ul>
<li>Even if you forget everything about Corpora, <b>remember this lesson</b>
</ul>
